# A library with a number of useful tools to deal with finite-state algorithms.

Currently holds a versatile automaton library, whose alphabet is not based on a defined set of strings, but on an implicit set of functions.
The automaton will nonetheless be used in a deterministic way (determism being built on-the-flight).

This library is currently used in the Ramses project, and will be used in Jsesh too.

The code has already a relatively long history, but we start from the current state.
